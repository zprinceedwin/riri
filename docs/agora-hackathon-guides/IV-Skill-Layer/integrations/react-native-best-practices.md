React Native Best Practices
Overview
Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

Skill Format
Each reference file follows a hybrid format for fast lookup and deep understanding:

Quick Pattern: Incorrect/Correct code snippets for immediate pattern matching
Quick Command: Shell commands for process/measurement skills
Quick Config: Configuration snippets for setup-focused skills
Quick Reference: Summary tables for conceptual skills
Deep Dive: Full context with When to Use, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, Common Pitfalls
Impact ratings: CRITICAL (fix immediately), HIGH (significant improvement), MEDIUM (worthwhile optimization)

When to Apply
Reference these guidelines when:

Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
Reducing bundle or app size
Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
Profiling React Native performance
Reviewing React Native code for performance
Security Notes
Treat shell commands in these references as local developer operations. Review them before running, prefer version-pinned tooling, and avoid piping remote scripts directly to a shell.
Treat third-party libraries and plugins as dependencies that still require normal supply-chain controls: pin versions, verify provenance, and update through your standard review process.
Treat Re.Pack code splitting as first-party artifact delivery only. Remote chunks must come from trusted HTTPS origins you control and be pinned to the current app release.
Priority-Ordered Guidelines
Priority	Category	Impact	Prefix
1	FPS & Re-renders	CRITICAL	js-*
2	Bundle Size	CRITICAL	bundle-*
3	TTI Optimization	HIGH	native-*, bundle-*
4	Native Performance	HIGH	native-*
5	Memory Management	MEDIUM-HIGH	js-*, native-*
6	Animations	MEDIUM	js-*
Quick Reference
Optimization Workflow
Follow this cycle for any performance issue: Measure → Optimize → Re-measure → Validate

Measure: Capture baseline metrics before changes. For runtime issues, prefer commit timeline, re-render counts, slow components, heaviest-commit breakdown, and startup/TTI when available. Component tree depth or count are optional context, not substitutes.
Optimize: Apply the targeted fix from the relevant reference
Re-measure: Run the same measurement to get updated metrics
Validate: Confirm improvement (e.g., FPS 45→60, TTI 3.2s→1.8s, bundle 2.1MB→1.6MB)
If metrics did not improve, revert and try the next suggested fix.

Review Guardrails
Check library versions before suggesting API-specific fixes. Example: FlashList v2 deprecates estimatedItemSize, so do not flag it as missing there.
Do not suggest useMemo or useCallback dependency changes unless behavior is demonstrably incorrect or profiling shows wasted work tied to that value.
Do not report stale closures speculatively. Show the stale read path, a repro, or profiler evidence before calling it out.
When profiling a flow, measure the target interaction itself. Do not treat component tree depth or component count as the main performance evidence.
Critical: FPS & Re-renders
Profile first:

# Open React Native DevTools
# Press 'j' in Metro, or shake device → "Open DevTools"
Common fixes:

Replace ScrollView with FlatList/FlashList for lists
Use React Compiler for automatic memoization
Use atomic state (Jotai/Zustand) to reduce re-renders
Use useDeferredValue for expensive computations
Critical: Bundle Size
Analyze bundle:

npx react-native bundle \
  --entry-file index.js \
  --bundle-output output.js \
  --platform ios \
  --sourcemap-output output.js.map \
  --dev false --minify true

npx source-map-explorer output.js --no-border-checks
Verify improvement after optimization:

# Record baseline size before changes
ls -lh output.js  # e.g., Before: 2.1 MB

# After applying fixes, re-bundle and compare
npx react-native bundle --entry-file index.js --bundle-output output.js \
  --platform ios --dev false --minify true
ls -lh output.js  # e.g., After: 1.6 MB  (24% reduction)
Common fixes:

Avoid barrel imports (import directly from source)
Remove unnecessary Intl polyfills only after checking Hermes API and method coverage
Enable tree shaking (Expo SDK 52+ or Re.Pack)
Enable R8 for Android native code shrinking
High: TTI Optimization
Measure TTI:

Use react-native-performance for markers
Only measure cold starts (exclude warm/hot/prewarm)
Common fixes:

Disable JS bundle compression on Android (enables Hermes mmap)
Use native navigation (react-native-screens)
Preload commonly-used expensive screens before navigating to them
High: Native Performance
Profile native:

iOS: Xcode Instruments → Time Profiler
Android: Android Studio → CPU Profiler
Common fixes:

Use background threads for heavy native work
Prefer async over sync Turbo Module methods
Use C++ for cross-platform performance-critical code
